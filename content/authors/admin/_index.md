I am a postdoc in the psychology department at the University of Washington. I work on several NIAAA- and NIDA-funded studies in which we aim to contribute to our understanding of the etiology of substance use disoders. Mainly, we study if and how emotions shape people's decision to consume (more) alcohol and cannabis. More generally, I am interested in mechanistic explanations of people's subjective experience of the world and decision-making, and have been a proponent of Open Science since starting grad school.
